            Growing up I have always been enthusiastic about cars and their mechanics.
            How exactly does an engine work? How to make an engine make more power?
            I am now older and as the saying goes "With age comes wisdom"
            I have even more complex questions. However, each day I am getting closer to getting answer for ever single one.
            <img class= blogpic src="blogpic1.jpg" alt="First Blog Picture" />
            Top of the list is how to manipulate the ECU or engine control unit, is a major component of a car's onboard computer
            However, being a Computer Science Major simply means I have an advantage as it relates to computers systems in general.
            When I complete my degree I intend to combine my skills with the craft I love to not only get my questions answered but also to share my knowledge with others.

            I believe BMW motor cars are the most superior. Although German brands are close in terms of similarity, their wheel drive system provides an enticing driving experience. Other German brands possess similar speed, power delivery, highly technical transmission and overall sporty look .

             I might be bias in terms of my preference because I love drag racing and drifting.Although possibly in other driving mechanisms, drifting especially is highly dependent on rear wheel drive. It is much easier to drift in rear wheel drive as the driver is better able to control the vehicle. Combining the impeccable handling of BMWâ€™s with the power to the rear wheels, it is the perfect driving machine. </p>
